Google Protocol Buffers
=======================

The [Google Protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) provide
a cross platform library for serialisation of data. This directory contains the `.proto`
files used to generate data objects within the GDSC SMLM code.


Support for TSF (Tagged Spot File) format
-----------------------------------------

The goal of the tagged spot file format is to provide an efficient data format
for superresolution microscopy data that generate images by locating the
position of single fluorescent emitters.

The orignal TSF description is available here:
[Tagged Spot File (TSF) format](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Tagged_Spot_File_(tsf)_format)

The format has been extended to add support for fields in the GDSC SMLM
software.


Automated Build
---------------

The Google `.proto` buffer file is used to generate Java code using the proto compiler (`protoc`).

The `protoc` compiler is automatically invoked by the `protobuf-maven-plugin` to generate
the Java source files during the Maven build process.

Manual Build
------------

You must have the binary `protoc` executable in your path. You can generate
the Java code for the GDSC SMLM project using for example:

        protoc --java_out=../java path/to/file/*.proto

This will produce the Java file(s) in the source tree.

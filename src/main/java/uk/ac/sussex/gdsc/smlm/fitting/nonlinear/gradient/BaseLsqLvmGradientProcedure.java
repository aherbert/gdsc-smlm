/**

 * to the parameters. This is used within the Levenberg-Marquardt method to fit a nonlinear model
 * with coefficients (a) for a set of data points (x, y).
 *
 * <p>Note that the Hessian matrix is scaled by 1/2 and the gradient vector is scaled by -1/2 for
 * convenience in solving the non-linear model. See Numerical Recipes in C++, 2nd Ed. Equation

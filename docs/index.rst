Overview
========

Super-resolution microscopy can be used to obtain a higher level of resolution from an image than conventional light microscopy.

In conventional light microscopy the subject is illuminated and all the light interacting with the subject is captured simultaneously into an image. The resolution is limited since the optics of the microscope cannot focus the light perfectly.

Super-resolution microscopy uses small molecules that can be activated to emit light. If a single molecule is activated its position can be localised using software analysis. Using thousands of localisations it is possible to reconstruct a virtual image of the subject. This increases the image resolution to the precision of the localisation method. The improvement depends on the imaging conditions but is often 5-10 times higher.

:numref:`Table %s <table_example>` shows the increased resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy. The difference is most noticeable where structures meet since the single molecules have a cleaner signal when activated individually than the combined signal of all the molecules together.

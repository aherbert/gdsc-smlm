 * the effect that the output function value is reduced by the scale factor. This will be the case
 * for offset parameters (if the offset is from zero) and magnitude parameters. An example is
 * y=m*x+c can be scaled to a*y=a*m*x+a*c. Interface methods that compute the function value are
 * rescaled after computation.

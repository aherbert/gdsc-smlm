GDSC SMLM Plugins for ImageJ: a collection of ImageJ plugins for
Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM), e.g. STORM, PALM.

Uses a 2D Gaussian to approximate the Point Spread Function (PSF) of
single fluorophores.

Contains routines for:

- Spot localisation using PSF fitting
- Drift correction using labelled regions
- Clustering using distance and time thresholds
- OPTICS/DBSCAN clustering
- Super-resolution image reconstruction
- Fourier Image Resolution
- Time-correlated PALM (tcPALM)
- PSF calculation using image acquisition details
- PSF estimation from image data
- PSF modelling from bead calibration images
- Camera noise modelling from calibration images

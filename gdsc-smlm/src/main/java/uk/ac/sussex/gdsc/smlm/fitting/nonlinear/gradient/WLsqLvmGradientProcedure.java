/**
 * Calculates the scaled Hessian matrix (the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a
 * function) and the scaled gradient vector of the function's partial first derivatives with respect
 * to the parameters. This is used within the Levenberg-Marquardt method to fit a nonlinear model
 * with coefficients (a) for a set of data points (x, y).
 *
 * <p>This procedure computes a modified Chi-squared expression to perform Weighted Least Squares
 * Estimation assuming a Poisson model with a Gaussian noise component. The weight per observation
 * is equal to 1/[variance + max(y, 0) + 1].

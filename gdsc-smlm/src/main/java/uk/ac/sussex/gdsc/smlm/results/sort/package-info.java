 * Java 1.7 Arrays.sort can throw an exception when Object1.compareTo(Object2) does not equal

 * <p>The exception is throw in java.utils.ComparableTimSort: throw new
 * IllegalArgumentException("Comparison method violates its general contract!");
 *
 * <p>This can occur when sorting mixed lists of PeakResult objects using their compareTo method as
 * sub-classes may have different a compareTo method. To work around this the compareTo method has
 * been removed from the PeakResult object and comparators added to this package for common
 * comparisons.

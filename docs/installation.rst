Installation
============

The plugin is designed to run within ``ImageJ``. This can be the original ``ImageJ`` (version 1) or any modified version of ``ImageJ`` such as ``ImageJ2`` or ``Fiji``.


.. index:: ! Install using ImageJ2/Fiji

Install using ImageJ2/Fiji
--------------------------

The SMLM plugins are distributed using an ``ImageJ2``/``Fiji`` update site. This allows the plugins to be easily installed and kept up-to-date. To install the plugins using ``Fiji`` just follow the instructions here:

* https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site

Add the ``GDSC SMLM2`` update site. ``Fiji`` will automatically check for a new version during start-up and install it if desired.

All the plugins will appear under the ``Plugins > GDSC SMLM`` menu.


.. index:: ! Install using ImageJ version 1

Install using ImageJ version 1
------------------------------

The plugin is designed to run within ``ImageJ``. You can obtain the latest version of ``ImageJ`` from:

* https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html

To get the plugins you can download the latest Jar files from the update site and put them in your ``ImageJ`` plugins folder. The jars can be found here:

* https://sites.imagej.net/GDSC-SMLM2/

You will also need to install the additional Apache Commons Math 3 library and EJML. These are already included in ``Fiji`` so are not on the update site. You can get the files here:

* `Apache Commons Math 3 <https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/commons/commons-math3/3.6.1/>`_
* `EJML v0.24 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ejml/files/v0.24/>`_

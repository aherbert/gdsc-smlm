/**
 * Provides classes for computation of cubic spline (CSpline) functions.
 *
 * <p>A cubic spline function can model the Point Spread Function (PSF) of a microscope and can be
 * fit to Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy data.
 *
 * <p>A cubic spline is defined using (X,Y,Z) dimensions. To model a PSF the Z coordinate is used to
 * define the XY slice of the spline. The functions in this package can compute the spline function
 * over a 2D (X,Y) range from the Z-slice that represents for example the pixels in an image. This
 * package evaluates the function as a single point for each (X,Y) position. That is the function
 * integral over the 1x1 area surrounding point (X,Y) is approximated using the function value at
 * (X,Y).

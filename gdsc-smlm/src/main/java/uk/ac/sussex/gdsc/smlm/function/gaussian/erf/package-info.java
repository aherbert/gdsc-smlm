/**
 * Provides classes for computation of 2D Gaussian function using the Error function.
 *
 * <p>The 2D Gaussian function is used as a model of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of a microscope
 * and can be fit to Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy data.
 *
 * <p>The functions in this package can compute the Gaussian function over a 2D range that
 * represents for example the pixels in an image. This package evaluates the function as an integral
 * over the 1x1 area surrounding point (X,Y).
 *
 * <p>The function is evaluated using the XY separability of the Gaussian. Each dimension must align
 * with the XY axes and so the functions <strong>cannot</strong> support rotated elliptical 2D
 * Gaussians.
 *
 * <p>This work is based on the paper:<br> Smith et al, (2010). Fast, single-molecule localisation
 * that achieves theoretically minimum uncertainty. Nature Methods 7, 373-375 (supplementary note).

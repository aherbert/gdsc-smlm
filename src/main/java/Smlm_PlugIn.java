/**
 * Default ImageJ plugin (no Java package) to run the {@link SmlmTools} plugin.
 *
 * <p><strong>This class is not included in the packaged uk.ac.sussex.gdsc.smlm jar.</strong>
 *
 * <p>This class allows the project to be run in debug mode from an IDE (e.g. Eclipse). The Maven
 * output directory will be target/classes. Create a symbolic link to that directory from the
 * project root and name it plugins. Optionally create a link to the macros directory to allow the
 * toolset to be loaded:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ${root}/plugins -&gt; ${root}/target/classes
 * ${root}/macros -&gt; ${root}/target/classes/macros
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Set the project to run ij.ImageJ as the main class and use the root directory as the ImageJ
 * path:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ij.ImageJ -ijpath ${root}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>ImageJ will load this class from the plugins directory. This class can call all other plugins.

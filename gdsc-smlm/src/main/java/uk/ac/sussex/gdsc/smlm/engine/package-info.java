/**
 * Provides the engine to perform filtering and fitting of Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy
 * (SMLM) data.
 *
 * <p>Data is processed as 2D frames from an image source. The engine distributes the input image
 * frames to workers for analysis. Each worker filters the frames to identify candidate
 * localisations and then fits the candidates using a Gaussian 2D function. The fits are assessed
 * using criteria such as localisation precision, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), drift, and spot
 * width. Fitting may not process all candidates due to the use of smart stopping criteria based on
 * the acceptance rate.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
